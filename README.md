# THE ADJUDICATOR Project Overview

## Project Description

THE ADJUDICATOR is a web application designed to settle disputes, arguments, debates, disagreements, bets, or anything where a neutral third party is needed to render judgment. Users can create sessions, invite others to participate, submit arguments with text and images, and receive AI-generated judgments.
